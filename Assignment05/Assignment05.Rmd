## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

2. Question 2 from assignment02: 

Assign a variable name to each of the following and use Python to identify the data type of each variable:
2
2.0
10j
2 Cool for School
True

```{r}

Two <- 2
class(Two)

TwoPointO <- 2.0
class(TwoPointO)

TenJ <- "10j"
class(TenJ)

Phrase <- "2 cool for school"
class(Phrase)

ThisIs <- "True"
class(ThisIs)
 
```


Question 5 from assignment05

This question was part of an in-person interview where you were expected to write the code on a board: "Design a function in which I can input a value, when I input the value, it returns the 4 possible outputs":
- If it is a multiple of 3 return the string "foo"
- If it is a multiple of 5 return the string "bar"
- If it is a multiple of 15 return the string "foobar"
- If it does not satisfy any of those, return the string "Not a multiple of 3, 5, or 15"


```{r}

FoobarFunction <- function(A){
# FoobarFunction will inform you if the entered value is a multiple of 3, 5, or 15. 
# It will display "foo", "bar", and "foobar" respectively.
# Precondition: This function will not work by typing in strings. 
# Examples below:
#>>> FoobarFunction(30)
# [1] "foobar"
#>>> FoobarFunction(20)
# [1] "bar"
# >>> FoobarFunction(6)
# [1] "foo"
#>>> FoobarFunction(17)
# [1] "Not a multiple of 3, 5, or 15"
#>>> FoobarFunction(six)
# Error in FoobarFunction(six) : object 'six' not found

if ((as.integer(B/3)) == B/3) {
Result <- "foo"
}
if ((as.integer(B/5)) == B/5) {
Result <- "bar"
}

if  ((as.integer(B/15)) == B/15) {
Result <- "foobar"
}
else 
Result <- "Not a multiple of 3, 5, or 15"
return(Result)
} 

```


3. Bring in dataset "swiss" (details about dataset here: swiss function - RDocumentation)

```{r}
help(swiss)

Data <- swiss
```

4. Provide the summary statistics for all the variables

```{r}
summary(swiss)
```


5. Which province has the highest percent of males involved in agriculture as their occupation 

```{r}

max(Data[c("Infant.Mortality")])

Province = "Porrentruy"


```


6. Provide the correlation values bewteen all the variables

```{r}

cor(Data)

```


7. Plot the relationship between fertility and education where fertility is on the y-axis and education is on the x-axis

```{r}

Fertility <- Data$Fertility
Education <- Data$Education

plot(Education, Fertility)

```


8. Provide a histogram of the % of individuals that were catholic

```{r}

Percent_of_Catholics <- Data$Catholic

hist(Percent_of_Catholics)

```
