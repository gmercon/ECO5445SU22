```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
```

```{r packages}
# Add any packages you want in this chunk:

library(readr)
library(gvlma)
library(MASS)

```

We are going to look at the property prices for Orange County. From there we are going to try and predict the sales price by linear regression.

# Importing Data 

Bring in the data and make sure the data types are correct. If not, make the proper changes. The file is located within this project. *data/prop_prices_reduced.csv*

```{r}

prop_prices_reduced <- read_csv("~/GitHub/ECO5445SU22/Assignment06/data/prop_prices_reduced.csv")
View(prop_prices_reduced)

prop_prices_reduced$sale_def <- prop_prices_reduced$sale_def/1000

attach(prop_prices_reduced)


```

- Here I changed sale_def and scaled those prices down by 1000. This will help the scale of the graphs later so the x and y borders are not so large.  


# Plotting

Plot histograms for all variables. Additionally, add scatter plots for the relationships between all quantitative variables.

- Here I included all the histograms and a scatterplot which has all relationships between each variable on one page. I also included some of the more important scatterplots, mainly the deflated sales by each variable.

```{r}

hist(sale_def, breaks = "fd",main = "Histogram of Sales Deflated")
hist(bed, main = "Histogram of # of Beds")
hist(bath, main = "Histogram of Baths")
hist(area_heated,breaks = "fd", main = "Histogram of Area Heated")
hist(area,breaks = "fd", main = "Histogram of Area")
hist(dist_cbd,breaks = "fd", main = "Histogram of Distance to CBD")
hist(dist_lakes,breaks = "fd", main = "Histogram of Distance to Lakes")
hist(pool, main = "Histogram of Houses with Pools")


plot(prop_prices_reduced, main = "Scatterplot of All Relationships")
plot(bed,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by # of Beds")
plot(bath,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by # of Bathrooms")
plot(area,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by Area")
plot(area_heated,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by Area Heated")
plot(dist_cbd,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by Distance to Central Business District")
plot(dist_lakes,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by Distance to Lake")
plot(pool,sale_def, main = "Sale Price by Pool")
plot(area,area_heated, main = "Area Heated by Total Area")


```

# Summary Statistics

Provide basic summary statistics for univariate analysis. Also, provide the correlation between all the quantitative variables.

```{r}

summary(prop_prices_reduced)

cor(prop_prices_reduced)

```

# Regression Analysis

Run a regression with all the variables included. Print results of the regression.

```{r}
scatterplotMatrix(prop_prices_reduced, smooth = FALSE, main = "Scatterplot Matrix")

fit <-lm(sale_def ~ bed + bath + area_heated + area + dist_cbd + dist_lakes + pool,data = prop_prices_reduced)

summary(fit)


```

Which of the variables tested significant at the 95% level? Looking at the results and answering outside of the chunk is sufficient.

Answer: The variables that tested significant at the 95% level include bed, bath, area heated, area, distance to cbd, and pool. This leaves distance to lakes as insignificant. Another thing to note is that pool tested significant at 95% while the rest of the variables tested significant at up to 99.99% 

## Evaluating the model

As is, are any of the Gauss-Markov assumptions violated? If so, which ones? How can you fix the issues?

```{r}
opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit)

par(opar)

durbinWatsonTest(fit)

gvmodel <- gvlma(fit)
summary(gvmodel)

qqPlot(fit, labels = FALSE, simulate = TRUE, main = "Q-Q Plot")


```



- It appears as though we have an outlier at index number 37. This appears to be causing a violation of Gauss Markov assumption #1. If we remove this outlier we will be studying a more homogenous sample. 

- We also see that distance to lakes is not significant. This is a violation of Gauss Markov assumption #3. I will adjust this by trying several variations. First we will change "distance to lakes" to a percentage by dividing the distance by the mean distance to lakes. I will then try to change the formula so that distance to lakes is included as a quadratic variable. Finally I will take the original formula and take the log of the deflated sales and the log of the distance to lakes. I will then compare the two formulas to see which has a higher R^2 and more significance.  


## New Model

Based off of your findings in the previous section, make changes to the variables, the functional form, etc.

```{r}

newdata <- prop_prices_reduced[-c(37),]
newdata$dist_lakes <- newdata$dist_lakes/mean(newdata$dist_lakes)


newfit1 <-  lm(sale_def ~ bed + bath + area_heated + area + dist_cbd + dist_lakes + pool + I(dist_lakes^2),data = newdata)
summary(newfit1)

newfit2 <-  lm(log(sale_def) ~ bed + bath + area_heated + area + dist_cbd + log(dist_lakes) + pool, data = newdata)
summary(newfit2)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(newfit1)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(newfit2)

par(opar)

gvmodelnew1 <- gvlma(newfit1)
summary(gvmodelnew1)

gvmodelnew2 <- gvlma(newfit2)
summary(gvmodelnew2)

qqPlot(newfit1, labels = FALSE, simulate = TRUE, main = "Q-Q Plot, Quadratic")
qqPlot(newfit2, labels = FALSE, simulate = TRUE, main = "Q-Q Plot, Log")


```

- It appears as though the quadratic transformation brought the adjusted R squared up to .68 while the log transformation brought it up to .73. The log transformation also brings up the significance of distance to lakes to above 95%. It also brings the residuals vs fitted values down to a much smaller error window, between 1 and -2. Overall the log transformation helps the fit of the regression model significantly. Even then not all gvmodel assumptions are corrected for. 


# Prediction

Based on the following inputs, predict the deflated sales price:

- 2 bed
- 2 bath
- area_heated = 1223
- area = 9750
- dist_cbd = 19368
- dist_lakes = 490
- no pool

```{r}

newhouse <- data.frame("bed" = 2,
                       "bath" = 2,
                       "area_heated"= 1223,
                       "area" = 9750,
                       "dist_cbd" = 19368,
                       "dist_lakes" = 490,
                       "pool" = 0)
predict(newfit2, newhouse)

exp(4.566142)

```
- The predicted log(sales price) is 4.566142. The actual value of the sales price would be $96,172.
